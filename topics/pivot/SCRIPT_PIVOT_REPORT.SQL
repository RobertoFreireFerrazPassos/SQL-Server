-- =============================================
-- Our task today is to create a report (using SQL Server PIVOT operator) 
-- where each city will be in a separate row, and where weâ€™ll count the 
-- number of all call outcomes related to each city. Therefore, all 
-- outcomes (all values from the dictionary) shall be columns in our 
-- report.
